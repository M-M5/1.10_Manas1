4/10/23 - Created the constructors for the pokemon. There may be an issue with the way I am calculating manhatten distance? Also I noticed that when I generate the moves for the pokemon, the move types do not correlate with that type of pokemon.
4/11/23 - My issue with the moves just needed me to place a -1 when getting the index value for the move. I've created wild pokemon that will spawn in, a battle scene for them as well. I'm trying to generate pokemon for the trainers but I'm currently
getting an error "poke327.cpp:883:24: error: invalid use of incomplete type ‘class PC’". Its weird because theres old parts of the code which is referencing player just fine. I'm not sure what exactly is going on.
4/12/23 - Fixed the circular reference bug. I added NPC battles, fixed the manhatten distance problem as well. I had an issue where NPC pokemon would get some crazy values, it was because I was doing something along
the lines of HP= blah blah blah + HP. HP doesn't have a value so I would get some crazy return values. Everything goes along with the PDF. I do have one issue though, its odd I wasn't having this in the previous assignment so some value must've changed. Once go through more than 1 different map, I get a floating point exception (core dump). I gotta find where this mysterious float is coming from.



4/15/23 - Began to create the structure of battles
4/16/23 - Continued making the wild Pokemon battles, I'm trying to make the system relatively similar to the original but 
its definitely more work than I want to do
4/17/23 - I've finished up the wild pokemon battles, the trainer battles will be pretty similar with some slight differences on how pokemon are chosen and how games are ended
4/18/23 - Finished NPC trainer battles. I've noticed a slight bug that when you click space during the main interface it will automatically battle pokemon, looking for a fix now.

4/21/23 - I've begun to add some houses, maybe I should make interiors? The idea is to have little towns here and there with gyms
4/22/23 - Removed the houses as they are unnecessary
4/23/23 - Took the formula for gaining xp from the pokemon wiki, dumbed it down and added it as a function. For some reason lvl 99s go back to a low level after gaining xp
4/24/23 - The issue with lvl 99s is that the values would overflow and reset, I added an if statement for the function to not work if the pokemon if lvl 99
Worked on creating gyms, although I'm having weird issues with my prototypes for gyms as they are not working they way intended
4/28/23 - Figured out a fix, although it's not what I like. I just have the gyms finish creating their leaders and such later in the code when I enter a building for the first time.
4/30/23 - I've set up the gyms such that you can now enter and battle the different leaders, and obtain badges.
There is a small bug where some gyms don't spawn, specifically pewter gym. 
4/31/23 - Fixed the issues with the gyms, i believe that occasionally either a pokecenter or pokemart spawn over them. the elite 4 gym would also occasionally spawn at 0, 0. i fixed that issue was well, it was due to random chance.
