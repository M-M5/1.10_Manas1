For this assignment, I have implemented a leveling up system as well as 9 different gyms. 
You must go through each gym in order to obtain the necessary badges in order to proceed to the next gym.
Each gym gets progressively harder as the pokemon which the leaders have are higher levels.
The gyms are inspired by the gyms in Pokemon firered.

New controls:
'G': Open gym map
'P': Open party
'M': 99 lvl pokemon cheat
